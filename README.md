## In which context did I this project? The goal of the project ?

I did this project at the end of the creation of a web site. And I would 
like to increase the google's referencing of the web site by create a 
fictive traffic to the web site from google thanks to a bot.

## The progress of the project

The project is finish for me, because I don't have the time to make it 
perfect but now it works with a website's url and a wordlist of possible
search.
We could improve it, by improving the bot and the function of the bot to 
make it more real. For example, click on the google customer opinion and 
next click on the web site : make it more real.

## The required file to execute this software

You need to have google chrome and selenium for the same version of google
chrome. And you have just to execute the Launch's class.
